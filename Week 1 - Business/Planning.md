### Planning

Network diagrams provide a visual representation of the project workflow
With the addition of time duration of each task, this can then be used to identify critical paths.
While easier to read than Gantt, network diagrams are less detailed.
Gantt charts display activities in a time frame.
Each activity has a start date, duration, and end date.
Gantt allows readers to see how activities relate to one another


### Why we plan

Planning is the key to success in terms of project management
Planning involves setting out a roadmap for the project by creating the following plans:

- Project plan
- Resource plan
- Financial plan
- Quality plan
- Acceptance plan
- Communications plan

If you fail to plan, you plan to fail


### A planning technique – Network diagrams

How to create a well thought out plan
1.	Task breakdown
2.	Estimation of durations (and cost)
3.	Understand logic dependencies
4.	Create network diagram
5.	Gantt chart

Network diagrams allow us to see logical order of our activities and define our critical paths

The network diagram allows us to see the logcal order of our activities and to define a critital path.
Critical path is the longest path.
 
Take the maximum one into account

The end nodes earliest start and latest start should always be the same. When working out the latest start work from right to left.
Latest start of predecessor = latest start on present node – duration of predecessor
Calculating latest start. Current node latest start – the predecessor’s duration

It is the longest path through the network-gives you a logical estimate on project length
A critical path will be the one with zero free float.
