### Example of introducing myself

After successfully completing my degree voluntarily attended the Finnish military where I spent one year in the urban warfare regiment. The thought of going out of my comfort zone and into a completely different culture motivated me to not only improve my physical fitness, but also to brush up on my language skills and communication. 
After returning to London I worked in the construction I was employed in the construction industry for around 6 months. The long physical hours motivated me to pursue a different career path, I wanted to find something that I was interested in and something that I had a passion for. After conducting research into different suitable career paths I came across Sparta global.
 The thought of becoming a dev ops engineer inspired me as It required little to no coding experience. Upon joining the course my passion for tech has been energised. So far on this course I have touched on things like PyCharm, git and git hub. we have also delved into coding languages such as python where I wish to continue to grow my knowledge and expand my knowledge.
