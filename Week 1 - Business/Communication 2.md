### Neuro-linguistic programming

NLP is the practice of understanding how people organise their thinking, feeling, language and behaviour to produce the results they do.
NLP is also used for personal development and for success in business
A key element of NLP is that we form our unique internal mental maps of the world as a product of the way we filter and perceive information absorbed through our five senses from the world around us
Shape your reality using these techniques.
“learning the language of your own mind”

### NLP in the workplace

- Studying language patterns to tailor communication methods – Building workplace relationships, influencing the way other people think.
- Managing emotions – control your reaction towards negative events, stress, anger.

### Cognitive biases

The mind is an operating system. It has multiple processes always running in the background. It can’t always work perfectly.
There are hidden flaws, backdoors and hacks that people can use to access our minds and subsequently our ways of working.

### Exploiting bias in the workplace

- Reactance – by telling people they are able to say no will make them more likely to say yes.
- Reciprocity – be the first to give: the feeling of obligation to give when you receive. Personalised and unexpected
- Door in the face – forcing people to refuse a large request increases the likelihood of agreeing to a second, smaller request.
- Likability – give compliments and build cooperation 
- The bystander effect – people look to others to determine their own actions


### Actions within the workplace

- Don’t stereotype
- Be open to ideas outside of your existing beliefs 
- Stay level headed and treat people with respect
- It isn’t personal, the way people act in pressured environments isn’t often a true representation of themselves.
- Create an environment that thrives on reciprocity.
